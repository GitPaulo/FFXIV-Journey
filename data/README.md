# How does this work?

The idea of this script is to pre-process Quest data from the datamining repository and convert it into a format that can be used by the application.

## Why?

The goal is to not rely on XIVAPI for quest data, pre-processing data also makes loading faster and for fun; trying to understand how the data is structured.

## Doesn't that mean you have to re-build the application every time the data changes?

Yes.
