# FFXIV Journey

![Title](image.png)

Sveltekit static site for tracking FFXIV MSQ quest progress.

The goal is to provide a **simple but well designed** way to track your progress whilst being **self-updating from open source datamining** sources.

## TODO

- [ ] Bug: Some MSQ ARR quests are missing.
- [ ] Must do: Replace the usage of old XIVAPI with the new one for unlocks
- [ ] Nice to do: Remove XIVAPI, entirely. Use the datamined data directly. (we use it for unlocks and assets)

Extra:

- [ ] Post-expansion quest separation (labels?)
- [ ] Quest graph viewer?
