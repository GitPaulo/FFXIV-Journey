# FFXIV Journey

![Title](image.png)

Sveltekit static site for tracking FFXIV MSQ quest progress.

The goal is to provide a **simple but well designed** way to track your progress whilst being **self-updating from open source datamining** sources.

## TODO

- [ ] Bug: MSQ ARR quests are not ordered and likely incorrect
- [ ] Trials a sub category of some MSQ quests would be cool
- [ ] Post-expansion quest separation (labels?)
- [ ] Quest graph viewer?
- [ ] Music/Rewards?
