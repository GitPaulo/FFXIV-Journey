# FFXIV Journey

![Title](image.png)

Sveltekit static site for tracking FFXIV MSQ quest progress.

The goal is to provide a **simple but well designed** way to track your progress whilst being **self-updating from open source datamining** sources.

## TODO

- [ ] Bug: Footer in laptop screens margins
- [ ] Bug: MSQ ARR quests are not ordered and likely incorrect
- [ ] Parse or remove quest description tags `<Emphasis>` etc
- [ ] Manual/auto mode for checking off quests
- [ ] Post-expansion quest separation
- [ ] Quest graph viewer?
- [ ] Music?
