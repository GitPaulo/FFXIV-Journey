# FFXIV Journey

![Title](image.png)

Sveltekit static site for tracking FFXIV MSQ quest progress.

The goal is to provide a **simple but well designed** way to track your progress whilst being **self-updating from open source datamining** sources.

## TODO

- [x] Finish post processing quest data into the right format
- [x] Correct checkbox system and progress bar updating
- [x] Local storage current checkbox data
- [x] Fancy loading!
- [x] Quest id link to quest lodestone/garland tools?
- [ ] Manual/auto mode for checking off quests
- [ ] Hide to show background/preview quest image
- [ ] Post expansion quest separation & improvements to ARR quests separation (confusing atm)
- [ ] Quest descriptions?
- [ ] Quest graph viewer!
- [ ] Music?
