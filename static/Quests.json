Riol also divulges that Wilred had begun to ask pointed questions, which likely led to his demise at the hands of these traitors.

There he tells you of his life before the imperial occupation, when a soldier sent away from the front to mend first heard the words of a revolutionary firebrand...\r\n\r\nAdrift in a memory of decades past, you observe Lyse's father deliver a speech to a crowd of cheering Ala Mhigans\u2500among them, Raubahn Aldynn and Ilberd Feare, then dear friends. Afterwards, the revolutionary meets with Raubahn and counsels him to remember that freedom should not be an end in of itself, for it is but a chance to build something better...and the work is never finished.\r\n\r\n\"Liberty or Death,\u201c Raubahn repeats; the creed of Curtis Hext and his comrades. Solemnly, he asks Lyse if she will swear by these words, and she does so\u2500though she is quick to add that the liberty she craves must be for every son and daughter of Ala Mhigo, even those who reject the cause. The nation they build must serve as a home for them all, she insists, and Raubahn can only agree.",

Though plainly displeased by this stipulation, Asahi eventually consents, but not without making one final request: a moment to speak with his beloved sister in private. Hien duly grants his wish, and Asahi is admitted to Yotsuyu's quarters. Doing your best to ignore Gosetsu's obvious anxiety, you wait without, imagining the worst, but when Asahi finally emerges, he concedes that Yotsuyu's condition is not feigned, and entrusts her to Hien's care. It would seem that all is well.",

Only then do you learn that your quarry is in fact the king and ruler of the faeries, Titania, who defeated a Lightwarden that had threatened Il Mheg, only to be corrupted by the aether that was subsequently released. Though the pixies are convinced that you will perish in the attempt, they readily agree to cooperate\u2500if for no other reason than that it would prove interesting to watch. They duly bestow upon you a white dress, one of four relics required to lift the seal over the castle. If you are to obtain the first of the three remaining items, you will need to set forth for the Untouchable Gate by the lake to request an audience with the slippery Fuath.",

All the pieces fall into place when Y'shtola subsequently returns brandishing a loaf of meol. With dread and disbelief, Ryne immediately recognizes the Eulmoran staple for what it is: sin eater flesh, the consumption of which apparently renders one susceptible to Vauthry's influence. This sickening revelation leaves everyone aghast, but the horrors do not end there... Recalling the words you heard during your first visit to Eulmore, Alphinaud shares his suspicion that citizens who have outlived their usefulness are being deliberately turned into sin eaters. Suppressing the urge to gag, you endeavor to put such thoughts from your mind, and concentrate instead on the task at hand: hunting down the Lightwarden. The being is all but certain to be hiding in Eulmore's upper levels, and it is decided that you will lead the charge into the city.",

In the course of the conversation, Shale recognizes Krile's earring to be a data storage device.

As their duel unfolds, the King of Resolve reveals that it is in fact the Queen of Reason who has orchestrated the attacks in order to plunder life force for her people. When Sphene personally appears to confirm the disturbing claim, Zoraal Ja unceremoniously cuts her down, thereby exposing that she is an illusion projected upon a mechanical soldier.\n\nAs the battle continues to unfold, Wuk Lamat divests Zoraal Ja of his advantage by destroying his regulator, but he responds by unleashing his war fleet on Tuliyollal. However, his forces are ultimately repelled, prompting him to take drastic measures. Having cut down his own aide for another regulator, he gives the order for all civilians in Everkeep to be executed for their souls, leaving Sphene horrified. It is at that moment that Gulool Ja unexpectedly appears to plead with his father, but Zoraal Ja takes him hostage and places Otis under his thrall. The king then flees, but not before challenging Wuk Lamat to come to the summit of Everkeep, there to settle matters once and for all.",
